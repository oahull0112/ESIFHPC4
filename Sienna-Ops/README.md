# Sienna

## Purpose and Description

- The Sienna framework is an open-source ecosystem for simulation and optimization of modern energy systems. It is designed to model, solve, and analyze scheduling problems and dynamic simulations of quasi-static infrastructure systems.
- Sienna consists of three main modules: **Sienna\Data**, **Sienna\Dyn**, and **Sienna\Ops**. This benchmark will focus on exercising **Sienna\Ops**, which enables simulation of system scheduling, including unit commitment, economic dispatch, automatic generation control, and nonlinear optimal power flow.
- The framework applies advanced computer science, visualization, applied mathematics, and computational science to create a flexible modeling environment for energy systems.

Users running this benchmark will be interacting primarily with `PowerSystems.jl` and `PowerSimulations.jl` packages from the Sienna framework.
`PowerSystem.jl` is the package that is used for creating and storing the power system that is being modeled. It stores the system as a JSON file and uses an H5 file to store timeseries data.
`PowerSimulations.jl` uses the `sys.json` created and loaded into the memory by PowerSystems.jl to create a simulation model and solve it using an MILP or NLP solver such as HiGHS or IPOPT, respectively.

## Licensing Requirements

Sienna is open-source software. Licensing details for its components can be found on the [Sienna GitHub repository](https://github.com/NREL-Sienna). 

## Other Requirements

Sienna requires Julia as the primary programming language and depends on several Julia packages, including `PowerSimulations.jl` and `PowerSystems.jl`.

## How to build and Run

### Instructions to build and install Sienna components:

1. Install Julia from [JuliaLang.org](https://julialang.org/). Specifically, we recommend using the [Manual Downloads](https://julialang.org/downloads/manual-downloads/), and selecting the current stable release (v1.12.5 as of February 9, 2026) appropriate for the target architecture. Below we show two options for building the Julia environment. 

#### Option 1: Use existing Project.toml and Manifest.toml files
2. Instantiate the `Project.toml` and `Manifest.toml` files in this directory. On 
the terminal, assuming that you are in the same directory as this
README.md, run
   ```shell
   julia --project=.
   ```
   ```julia
   ] instantiate
   ```
   This should install all the packages needed to run the benchmark

#### Option 2: Build your own Julia environment

2. Add the required packages using the Julia package manager:
   ```julia
   ] add PowerSimulations PowerSystems@4 HydroPowerSimulations PowerSystemCaseBuilder
   ```
3. Addtional tools used in the benchmark:
   ```julia
   ] add BenchmarkTools CSV DataFrames
   ```
4. Add requisite solvers
   ```julia
   ] add HiGHS IPOPT
   ```

### Instructions on how to run the Sienna benchmark:

#### Running the benchmark from the command line
1. Run the benchmark as follows
   ```shell
   julia --threads=auto --project=. small/run_RTS_UC-ED.jl
   ```

#### How we ran this benchmark on Kestrel:
1. Modify and run the sbatch file `run_benchmarks.sh` as follows

   ```shell
   sbatch run_benchmarks.sh 1 1 
   sbatch run_benchmarks.sh 104 auto
   ```

Note: The fist argument after `run_benchmarks.sh` specifies `OMP_NUM_THREADS` to be used, the second argument specifies how many threads julia should be started with. By default, Julia uses only one thread. setting number of threads to `auto` means that Julia will set the number of threads to be equal to the number of cores on the system.

## Run Definitions and Requirements

- The benchmarks include:
  - Unit Commitment and Economic Dispatch simulations using `PowerSimulations.jl`.
- The input data for these simulations is compatible with `PowerSystems v4.0`.

Note: There is a new version of Sienna that uses `PowerSystems v5.0`. However, this benchmark uses `PowerSystems v4.0`. Data sets and code may be updated to work with the latest version of Sienna, but this is not required. 

## Run Rules

- The Benchmarks are single node only and must be run sequentially so as to not fight for resources.
- GPU-compatible Optimizers that are compatible with Julia JuMP may be exercised on GPU nodes if desired. However, this is not a requirement.

## Benchmark test results to report and files to return

The benchmark creates timing, memory, and allocation data that can be inspected visually for comparison.
