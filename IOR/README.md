# IOR

Source code: [https://github.com/hpc/ior](https://github.com/hpc/ior/releases/tag/4.0.0)

Documentation: https://ior.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

## Purpose and Description

IOR is designed to measure parallel file system I/O performance through a variety of potential APIs. This parallel program performs writes and reads to/from files and reports the resulting throughput rates. 

We use this benchmark to understand the performance of the proposed file systems.

## Licensing Requirements

IOR is licensed under GPLv2, see [here](https://github.com/hpc/ior?tab=License-1-ov-file)

## How to build

Documentation on installation [here](https://ior.readthedocs.io/en/latest/userDoc/install.html).

See `kestrel_example_build_script.sh` used to build IOR on Kestrel.

These tests require MPI and HDF5.

**Note on versions used:** 
The following packages and versions were used to obtain reference results on the Kestrel system:
* IOR v3.3.0
* MPI cray-mpich v8.1.28
* HDF5 hdf5-parallel v1.12.2.9

The offeror is free to use newer versions of these packages. Please note that different versions of IOR allow for different combinations of keywords and may behave in different ways. The reference input files apply to IOR version 3.3.0. If the offeror wishes to use a newer version of IOR, input files may requiring updating in order to generate an equivalent test. These modifications are allowed, as long as the modified input files and a brief description of the equivalence are returned as part of the response. For example, IOR 3.3.0 allows for `blockSize` = `transferSize`, which we use to set up the random IO test described in #3 below (`test3_random_posix.ior`). However, in IOR v4.0.0, our input test file will cause a "blockSize and transferSize cannot be the same" error, so an equivalent random access test would need to be created by modifying the `blockSize` to be consistent with this change.


## Run Definitions and Requirements

We define four IOR tests. Sample input files for these tests can be found in the IOR-tests folder. 

1. Fully sequential, large-transaction reads and writes, file-per-process, POSIX and MPI-IO
2. Fully sequential, large-transaction reads and writes, single file, MPI-IO only
3. Random, small transaction reads and writes, file-per-process, POSIX-only
4. HDF5 test meant to replicate the IO patterns of the [Rev](https://github.com/NREL/reV) application. Similar to Test 2, but with api=HDF5 and each MPI task writing/reading to/from its own dataset in the HDF5 file.

For all tests:
- Repeat for each offered filesystem
- The size of the file must exceed 1.5x the aggregate RAM available
- Allow segment count to vary in order to fulfill the 1.5x RAM requirement
- Only the maximum, reproducible transfer rate achieved should be reported.
- Optimizations that would allow for page caching are not allowed.

For tests 1 and 2, and 4:
- Execute on a single node, 10% of offered nodes, and the number of nodes that results in max bandwidth.
- The single node test and the 10% of nodes test must be run with 80% of available cores subscribed. In addition, the vendor can optionally execute these tests with an optimal number of available cores, if this number is less than 80% of available cores.
- Transfer and block size can be changed to achieve optimal performance
- At least 80% of the node's RAM must be pre-populated (i.e. `memoryPerNode = 80%` or higher)

For test 3:
- Execute with POSIX only
- Execute on 10% of offered nodes only
- Transfer and block size cannot be changed
- At least 80% of the node's RAM must be pre-populated (i.e. `memoryPerNode = 80%` or higher)

In all cases, changes related to tuning must be practical for production utilization of the filesystem. For example, tuning that optimizes random I/O at the expense of large streaming I/O would not be practical for our expected mixed workload. The Offeror shall include details of any optimizations used to run these benchmarks, and distinguish parameters which may be set by an unprivileged user from those which would be globally set by system administrators.

## How to run

A sample input for each of the four tests is provided in the `IOR/IOR-tests/` folder.

For a full set of IOR inputs, see [IOR options](https://ior.readthedocs.io/en/latest/userDoc/options.html)

See an example `kestrel_example_sbatch_script.sh` used to submit, e.g., `test1_nn_mpi_io.ior` job on one node. 

Kestrel `module list` output before running tests on CPU nodes:

PFL striping commands on Kestrel to create target test directories:
* kfs2 
```
cd /projects/<project>/ior-tests/
mkdir kfs2
lfs setstripe -p disk1 -E 8M -c 1 -E 256M -c 4 -S 4M -E -1 -c -1 -S 4M ./kfs2
```
* kfs3-disk
```
cd /scratch/<username>/ior-tests/
mkdir kfs3-disk
lfs setstripe -p disk2 -E 8M -c 1 -E 256M -c 4 -S 4M -E -1 -c -1 -S 4M ./kfs3-disk
```
* kfs3-flash
```
cd /scratch/<username>/ior-tests/
mkdir kfs3-flash
lfs setstripe -p flash -E 8M -c 1 -E 256M -c 4 -S 4M -E -1 -c -1 -S 4M ./kfs3-flash
```

## Benchmark test results to report and files to return

In addition to items enumerated in the General Benchmark Instructions,

the Text response should include a high-level description of optimizations that would permit NREL to understand and replicate the optimized runs, as well as a description of:
- Relevant client and server features (node and processor counts, processor models, memory size, speed, OS)
- Client and server configuration settings important to understand performance
- Network interface options
- File system configuration options
- Storage and configuration for each file system
- Network fabric used to connect servers, clients, and storage
- Network configuration settings

The file response should include all and only those log files corresponding to runs with performance numbers in the Spreadsheet response
